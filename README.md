Demand-Forecasting

                                                            ABSTRACT
Demand forecasting is one of the main issues of supply chains. It aimed to optimize stocks, reduce costs, and increase sales, profit, and customer loyalty. For this purpose, historical data can be analyzed to improve demand forecasting by using various methods like machine learning techniques, time series analysis, and deep learning models. In this work, an intelligent demand forecasting system is developed. This improved model is based on the analysis and interpretation of the historical data by using regression model and predict the accuracy of the model so that we can decide whether the demand is low or high and even the price to be kept. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to blend the regression  model by a novel decision integration strategy for demand forecasting approach. The other novelty of this work is the adaptation of boosting ensemble strategy to demand forecasting system by implementing a novel decision integration model. The developed system can be applied and tested on real life data A wide range of comparative and extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed demand forecasting system exhibits noteworthy results.Regression strategy for forecasting system ensures significant accuracy improvement.

This experiment demonstrates the steps in building a Demand Forecasting. Demand forecasting is a field of predictive analytics, that aims to predict the demand of customers. It is done by analyzing statistical data and looking for patterns and correlations. Machine learning takes the practice to a higher level.
Demand is predicted using both qualitative and quantitative methods. In the most basic form, it is done by leveraging the experience of the seller or collective brainstorming in the company. Another popular way is to ask the customers. Conducting market surveys is one of the simplest methods of demand forecasting and may be applied in all industries, no matter the size or market segment. Other common methods include delphi forecasting method that relies on a panel of experts answering questions or employing game theory an leveraging.         
Linear Regression can be highly beneficial for companies to develop a forecast of the future values of some important metrics, such as demand for its product or variables that describe the economic climate. Linear regression can be used in both types of forecasting methods. In the case of causal methods, the causal model may consist of a linear regression with several explanatory variables. This method is useful when there is no time component. For example, a company might want to forecast when a material will melt under different conditions of temperature and pressure.         
 the knowledge of classification of the customers using decision tree as an input to the demand forecasting in retail sale. The paper suggests a model which has been used in retail sale for better forecasting of demands and improved performance of inventory in overall supply chain management. The proposed forecasting model with the inventory replenishment system results in the reduction of inventory level and increase in customer service level.                                 

            

                                                           MODELLING
In today’s framework, There is always a context surrounding customer behavior. It may be an upcoming holiday, the weather or a recent event. As real product demand varies, businesses may face two challenges:
•	Income and profit loss when a product is out of stock or a service is unavailable
•	Cash tied up in stock or
•	The reduced margins that come with getting it out of warehouses
•	provides reasonable data for the organization's capital investment and expansion decision.
•	 planning the production process, purchasing raw materials, managing funds, and deciding the price of the product.


 

                                                           CONCLUSION 
Proper demand forecasting enables better planning and utilization of resources for business to be competitive. Forecasting is an integral part of demand management since it provides an estimate of the future demand and the basis for planning and making sound business decisions. A mismatch in supply and demand could result in excessive inventory and stock outs and loss of profit and goodwill. Both qualitative and quantitative methods are available to help companies forecast demand better. Since forecasts are seldom completely accurate, management must monitor forecast errors and make the necessary improvement to the forecasting process.
